### Why i upload ?
##### Because the OS always tries to force me to use the latest system-version to use these apps, but I don't like new OS.
##### The bad news is that the AppStore says these apps only work on OS 14 and above, so I remembered this zip-compressed app I used before,
##### and i wanna share this with people like me who can't or don't want to upgrade their system but still need to use it.

### System version needed ?
##### OS 11 or above, because i haven't the older version. If u want the older version u may find the other web ?



### Finally
##### If u r still using old-version OS for various reasons, here's some of my psn advice.

##### [1] If not absolutely necessary, try using a free tool like OnlyOffice and save as generic format (such like docx//pdf and more), because being able to open and read a document is always the most important thing, although iWork's editor is indeed very easy to use.

##### [2] If you have some files in a special format, but have lost the application to open them, u can try converting the format online (iWork can be managed via the iCloud web or online format conversion web), or look for offline tools (such as FileCoverter).

### Other

##### [3] Although I'm a user of older operating systems and firmly refuse to use anything above OS 12 (because the T2 chip and online system installation cause me numerous errors, for reasons I don't understand), I still recommend that anyone else try a newer OS.
Updating and iteration are always necessary. You can keep an old computer as a memento, but if you're using it for work, consider upgrading. As the saying goes, "A tool for making a living should be efficient and functional, not just aesthetically pleasing. (吃飯的傢伙總是需要順手高效而不是好看)"

#### Wish you have a great day anyway :).
